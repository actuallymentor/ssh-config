# Auto setup of Passwordless login and ZSH

Setting up my SSH connections the way I like them. Not very elegant since it requires manual commands. 

* Add a deployment user
* Add an ssh key for that user
* Install zsh
* Install oh my zsh
* Configure zsh

## Quickstart
* Clone this repo
* **Edit the ~/.ssh/deploy.pub** to hold your own key, right now it holds one of mine
* Run ```shell bash setup.sh```, it will walk you through setup
